# OpenDraft

## What is it?

OpenDraft is a free and open source hybrid fantasy football draft site. It is meant to be a free alternative to sites like [ClickyDraft](https://clickydraft.com/draftapp/).

## What is a "hybrid" fantasy football draft?

A hybrid draft is a draft that is held partially live and in person, and partially virtual. This means that you can have a draft party where those that are able to make it can place their picks live and have them shown on a draft board displayed on a TV, and those that can not make it can follow along and place their own picks remotely from their devices.

## Why make it?

The original reason for creating OpenDraft was that my fantasy league used ClickyDraft for several years, and while we were mostly satisfied with the service it provided, we felt it could be an overall better experience. So I decided to start working on this, and it's become a great learning tool for React and Firebase.
